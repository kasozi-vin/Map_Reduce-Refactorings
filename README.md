# Map_Reduce-Refactorings
This repository contains code snippets that show a shift from using loops to using the HOFs, map and reduce(foldl) to implement programs that manipulate data that can fit on a standard pc
It is intended to show a shift in thinking from using mutative programming to using immutability to do useful work. The work in this repository using concepts from functional programming and hence you may need to know some functional programming before it can make sense to you.
